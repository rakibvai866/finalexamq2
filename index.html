As of my last update in September 2021, CSS allows using multiple background images for a 
single element, such as a div. This feature is achieved using the background-image property, 
and you can stack multiple images by separating them with commas.Here's an example of using 
multiple background images in a div: <br><br>

In this example, we have a div with the class multi-background-div. The CSS for this class 
specifies three background images, image1.jpg, image2.jpg, and image3.jpg. They will be 
layered on top of each other, with image1.jpg at the top, followed by image2.jpg, and 
finally, image3.jpg at the bottom.We set different positions, sizes, and repeat properties 
for each image. In this case, image1.jpg will be displayed at the top left corner, image2.
jpg will be centered, and image3.jpg will be repeated as a pattern throughout the div. You 
can adjust these properties based on your specific requirements.Make sure to replace image1.
jpg, image2.jpg, and image3.jpg with the actual paths to your desired image files.
